# README

This is a simple DB with one table requested as a tech-test for a mock interview with Domain.

It uses Ruby on Rails with a postgresql database, so to run this locally you'll need to have both.

To get this running locally you should navigate to the root directory of the project in the command line and run the following commands:
bundle install
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails s
